You can find a smart contract of an ERC20 token. Please treat this as a clientâ€™s audit request and do the following:
1. Estimate how much hours of work it will be from your side.
2. Explain what process you will follow to Audit the Smart Contract.
3. Present the findings of the Smart Contract in a Small Text File, for each finding paste the related block of code that justifies the finding.
4. The Smart Contract will be used on a LaunchPad for I.D.O., mention any Security Threat for Investors, and any Problem the Smart Contract
Development Team might encounter.
